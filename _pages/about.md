Hi! My name is Sina, and I'm an avid traveler with a passion for flying. Over the years, I've been fortunate to experience many different airlines and journey to various parts of the world.

I created this blog to share my experiences, both the good and the bad, in hopes that they might be useful, entertaining, or inspiring to others. Here, you'll find detailed posts about my trips, from the quality of airline services to the sights and experiences of my destinations.

When I'm not in the air or writing about my latest adventure, I enjoy codeing and excersising. 

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy reading about my journeys as much as I enjoyed experiencing them.
